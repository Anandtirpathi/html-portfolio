<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m someone who’s always believed that passion, curiosity, and
a little bit of chaos make life exciting. I’m currently pursuing my degree
in Computer Engineering, and for me, tech isn't just about circuits and code—it’s about building things that actually make life better.
I love exploring how technology works under the hood, whether it's understanding processors, designing smart systems,
or creating something from scratch that just works. I get excited about projects that challenge me to think differently,
push boundaries, and blend logic with creativity. I may not have all the answers yet,
but I’m always ready to dive deep, learn fast, and build with purpose.</p>

<p>Outside the academic hustle, I’m the kind of person who thrives on staying active and creative.
I play sports like pickleball almost daily—it’s my way of staying energized and sharp.
I'm also someone who loves good conversations, long walks in parks, and collecting little moments that make life feel special.
I enjoy working on personal projects, helping friends with tech stuff,
and occasionally getting lost in deep YouTube rabbit holes about random topics.
I believe in keeping things real, staying kind, and always dreaming a little bigger than necessary.
Whether it’s through tech, teamwork, or just being a good human—I want to leave things a bit better than I found them.</p>
